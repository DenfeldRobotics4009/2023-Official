Robot code for 2023 frc game season

This is our first swerve drive robot. Featuring a drivetrain capable of automatically adjusting amount of
force applied on each wheel when the current speed does not match the theoretical speed. As well as
aligning itself with, and orbit around a limelight target.

We decided viewing apriltags in this game is not necissary, so we focused on using limelight to recognize
the cubes and cones within the game.
